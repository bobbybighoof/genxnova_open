		It will let you move a lot faster

		Remove mode turns the yellow build box
		into a red one that shows you what blocks
		are going to be removed.
		This is especially helpful for removing
		larger areas.

		Lighten mode removes any shadows and
		shading from the blocks, lighting
		up dark areas to make it easier
		to see when building. Keep in mind
		to disable it once in a while to see 
		how good your ship looks with lighting enabled.

		The three sliders are one of the best tools 
		for building. They will increase the build area
		so multiple blocks can be build/removed at once.
		Servers have different max settings, and you
		can set them for your single player game
		in the server.cfg file.

		Orientation is available if a rotatable block
		is selected. Those blocks
		are either blocks with individual sides
		or special shapes like wedges.
		
		You can also rotate through the block orientations
		with the mouse wheel while holding $BUILD_MODE_FIX_CAM

		Copy/paste lets you select an area and paste it,
		providing you have the required blocks.
		Click on "copy" and then select the area
		to copy then click on paste to place
		it down again. Connections will be copied
		if the controller and controlled blocks are both
		in the copied area.

		Symmetry planes are probably the best tools in the game. 
		You place down 'walls' that divide your structure in parts. 
		Placing a block on one side will also place the
		block on the other side. 'odd' symmetry just lets you 
		move the wall to the middle of a block.
		You can use multiple symmetry planes to
		maximize your building speed.

		The remove filter is a great tool to quickly refit your ship!
		You can select a block from the drop down menu
		(or use the filter above to search for specific names) and only
		the selected block will be removed when right clicking.
		
		This works with larger build areas and symmetry.
