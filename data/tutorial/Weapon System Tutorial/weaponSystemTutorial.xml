		StarMade has four main weapon types at this point.
		Antimatter Cannons, Missiles, Damage Pulse 
		and Damage Beam. Each weapon is useful on its own 
		but in most situations a specific weapon
		will be the most effective.

		StarMade uses a combination system for this.
		You can link two main computers together to
		change how the weapon behaves.
		
		Each weapon has a secondary effect, that will
		be applied to the weapon it is linked to.

		Secondary effects:
			Cannons: Makes the weapon reload faster (machine-gun).
			Missile: Splits up the weapon into smaller parts (shotgun).
			Pulse: Increases the weapon damage (High calibre).
			Beam: Makes the weapon range greater and and the 
				  projectile faster (sniper).

		As mentioned before, you have to connect
		two weapon computers together to combine them.
		
		Both weapon computers have to have
		weapon modules connected to them.

		The ratio of connected blocks on each of
		the connected systems determines how much
		of the secondary effect the main weapon will
		receive. 
		The damage however will be determined by the total block 
		count from all weapon blocks.

		Example, a weapon that uses 50 blocks in 
		combination with another weapon that uses 50
		blocks has the same damage per second as a single weapon 
		with 100 blocks.

		Try this now. Place down a weapon computer
		and connect 5 weapon modules to it.
		
		Next, place another weapon computer down
		and connect 5 weapon modules to that.

		Now press $SELECT_MODULE on the weapon
		computer you want to use as your main weapon.
		
		Finally press $CONNECT_MODULE on the second weapon computer. 
		The coloured boxes around the computers will now 
		indicate its connection.

		You can also do the same with the 'drag and drop' feature 
		in the weapon menu (open with $WEAPON_PANEL). Just pick
		a weapon and drag it into the slave slot of another.
		
		You can also unlink by selecting a slave and dropping 
		it in the unlink box.

		Your cannon will now fire 15 times faster 
		but each shot will do less damage.
		The total DPS will be the same as one cannon computer
		with 10 cannon modules linked to it.

		If you connect 7 blocks to the main computer and 
		3 to the secondary,	you will only get around half 
		of the reload buff but each shot will do more damage. 
		
		The DPS remains unchanged.		
		This way you can fully customize your weapon.
