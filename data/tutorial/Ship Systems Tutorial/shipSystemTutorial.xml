		A lot of systems work best in block-groups.
		A block-group consists of two or more
		blocks of the same type that are all touching each other. 
		
		A solid big cube of blocks is an example of a block-group, 
		but the same goes for a line.

		For some systems, it is more efficient
		to arrange the groups in a certain way.
		
		The power recharge system uses this type, allowing the player 
		to construct a powerful reactor as efficient as possible.

		In this case, the dimension of the block-groups matter. 
		This means that a solid big cube of
		recharge power modules gives a lot less energy than the same
		amount of blocks, laid out in a giant three-dimensional cross.

		Another example for block-groups are the weapon modules.
		Each group of weapons will fire one projectile. 
		
		You can either have one	big group, or multiple 
		weaker small ones. Keep in mind that you'll 
		receive a penalty, depending on 
		how many separate weapon groups you have.
