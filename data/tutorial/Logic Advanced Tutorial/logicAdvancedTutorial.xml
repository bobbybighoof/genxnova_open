		Welcome to the Advanced Logic Tutorial.
		
		In the basic tutorial, you were introduced to the
		activation block, which is the most vital block
		in the system. Here you will learn about all
		the other blocks used in logic and its triggers.

		As you now know, you can link blocks together
		to make a chain to remote control
		the block at the end. You can build 
		a lot more complex things though.
		This is where the NOT, OR, AND, and DELAY blocks
		come into play.

		Every one of these blocks can be linked just
		like the activation blocks. 
		
		The simplest one to understand is probably the NOT block.
		What it does is simply inverting an incoming signal 
		from 'on' to 'off' and vice versa.

		The more complicated blocks are the
		AND and OR blocks. 
		Those blocks will need multiple inputs. 
		The inputs can by any logic blocks, even OR and AND
		themselves.

		AND will look at all the blocks that are
		connected to it and only output the 'on'
		signal when ALL of the receiving signals are 'on'.

		Now to the delay block.
		The delay block takes a signal on/off and 
		outputs it just like the activation block.
		
		However, it will not do this immediately 
		but with a delay.

		The delay block enables players to build
