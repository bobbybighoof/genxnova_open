		Your ship HP depend on how many 'System' blocks
		like power, weapons, or shields you have on your ship.
		
		When you lose those blocks, your HP will go down, which has 
		several negative effects.
		Your ship will start overheating at 50%. At that point you will
		have to decide if you want to try to rescue your ship or flee.

		To reset your HP to 100% you will have to 'reboot' your systems.
		This can be done by pressing '$REBOOT_SYSTEMS' in build mode. Rebooting takes
		time depending on your lost HP and ship size, but can also be done
		instantly on shops for credits.
	
		When overheating you cannot enter the ship again until rebooted.
		At this point you will be promted to reboot if you try to enter
		the core.

		Armor follows the same principle as structure HP, with the
		difference that different blocks provide it, and that you can
		only reset it to 100% on shops for credits.
		
		Armor absorbs 50% of all damage as long as you have any armor left.
