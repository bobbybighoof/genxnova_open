		To dock, you need a "fixed docking module",
		or a "turret docking module". When placing it
		down, you can change its orientation in the
		advanced build mode.

		When it is placed down, you should see the docking
		area. If it is not green, then something is
		blocking it. A docking area must be completely
		free from any block.

		You can increase the size of the area
		by linking docking enhancer blocks to it.
		Just press $SELECT_MODULE on the docking
		module and place down some enhancers.
		The size is determined by the shape of
		its enhancers. They must be placed in connecting groups.

		A ship is docked at the centre relative to
		its size. The ship core will appear right above the docking port 
		and all parts sticking out must fit in the green area.
		A turret needs to have its core on the bottom. 
		That means you cannot build below
		the core if you want to use it as a turret.

		To dock, select the docking beam (which also
		activates doors and other activatable blocks)
		and shoot it on the docking block.
		Right click will ignore doors so you can dock 
		without closing them instead.

		If you have problems with docking,
		dock a single core, and then build on
		it from its docked position to fully 
		understand how the docking area system works.
		
		If you build on a docked ship, un-docking
		and re-docking might change its position.

		You can also chain-dock multiple ships

		For turrets to be AI controlled,
		you have to have the turret factioned with
		the faction block and also equip it with an AI Module.
		Press $ACTIVATE on it to make sure it is set to 'turret',
		then you can either activate it there, or do the same
		from the structure panel.
