		The system works by connecting
		blocks with each other to create
		basic circuits similar to electronic ones.
		These circuits are called 'logic gates'.

		The most important block in the logic system
		is the 'Activation Block'. This block can be
		turned on and off by pressing $ACTIVATE on it.
		
		It can also share this on/off signal to all the blocks 
		that are connected with it.

		To connect a block, press $SELECT_MODULE on one activation
		block to select it, and $CONNECT_MODULE on the block you want to
		connect it to.

		When you place an activation block,
		and connect it to another activation block,
		both blocks will be activated if you press $ACTIVATE
		on the first one.
		Activation blocks can also be linked to doors, lights,
		weapon computers, and anything else that can be
		activated in Starmade.

		They can also be linked to gravity modules,

		to the gravity module at this moment.
