		This is build mode. It's best to build in this mode,
		as you can accelerate movement with Right Shift, and
		pass through anything. You are also always aligned to
		this ship, and of course you can use the advanced
		build tools.

		Very nice!
		Note, that you can save a blueprint of a ship at any time
		in the 'Catalog', buy a copy of it at any shop
		and then spawn it by just providing
		the necessary blocks.
		
		Just press '$CATALOG_PANEL' to open the catalog panel. 
		
		You can even bring your own creations
		into other universes (multiplayer servers).
