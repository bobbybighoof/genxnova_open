		At this moment, hiring crew can only be done
		at an advanced shop. Those shops are located in
		the starting sector of new worlds but also
		spawn randomly, although more rarely than normal shops.
		
		To find them, check your navigation panel
		for Trading guild NPCs during your travels.

		That doesn't mean that you can only get 5 in total.
		However, you can only have 5 at a time that follow
		your direct commands.
		You can discharge NPCs to your ship and get more.
		They will wait for you. Just press $ACTIVATE on one of 
		your crew members and tell him to wait or join you.

		Note that NPCs have a "home" they
		belong to (like a ship). To attach them
		to your ship, tell them to follow you.
		
		Then go to your ship and tell them to go to a
        point on your ship. This will make the ship
        their new 'home', and they will move with it.
